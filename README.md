# DC-Residential-Properties Visualization Web App
DC Residential Properties web app was developed with the aim of providing user the information 
regarding the DC Properties. The user can select different variables in the widget and see the 
variation of prices of DC properties based on those variables. We have also provided an 
interactive map for the convenience of the users. They can select a zip code and see the location 
wise details of each and every property. The users can hover over the map and see details about 
each and every property.
The main purpose of building this app is to help user provide accurate information and trend 
about the DC Residential properties and help them figure out which property is best for them.
# Main tasks:
